# Rails Template

This is a basic rails applicaiton with the common technlologies that I use to build a webapp.  
It is a multi page app in the classic rails style.  The design (for what it is worth) is not really for an 
end user, but for a site administrator. 
It assume that you are
using docker... but that is all that is required.  It does NOT use APIs or any 

## Commands

* docker-compose build
* docker-compose up
* docker-compose down

To connect in another window

* docker-compose exec app /bin/bash

## Technologies

* rails 5
* bootstrap 4
* docker et al
* rspec, factory_bot, (faker)
* chartkick & google charts
* groupdate to group for charts
* font awesome for the icons
